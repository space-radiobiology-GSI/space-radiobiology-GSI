# Welcome to our GitHub!

We are the friendly folks of the Vandevoorde group (space-radiobilogy-GSI) at GSI, Germany.


We are studying the effects of space born radiation on the microbiome and gastrointestinal tract itself.
By doing so, we hope to better understand the changes and effects caused by radiation, so we can develop effective countermeasures for the future space explorers. 🚀

Although a bit empty at the moment, in our future repositories, you will hopefully find data analysis scripts connected to our research and to all things radiation related. ☢ 🙂
